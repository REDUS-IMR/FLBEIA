\description{
Estimates selectivity at age of an stock by a fleet and metier.
}
\details{
To calculate selectivity at age, the following formula is used:

\deqn{ C_{a,f,m} = \frac{C_{f,m}}{sum_{i=a_0,...a+} S_{i,f,m} \cdot B_i} \cdot S_{a,f,m} \cdot B_a } 

Where:

\itemize{
     \item{a:} age. 
     \item{f:} fleet. 
     \item{m:} metier. 
     \item{i:} susbscript of age. 
     \item{\eqn{S_{a,f,m}}:} selectivity at age 'a' for fleet 'f' and metier 'm'. 
     \item{\eqn{C_{a,f,m}}:} catch (in weight) at age 'a' for fleet 'f' and metier 'm'. 
     \item{\eqn{C_{f,m}}:} total catch for fleet 'f' and metier 'm'. 
     \item{\eqn{B_a}:} biomass (in weight) at age.  
}

Consult \href{https://github.com/flr/FLBEIA/blob/master/inst/doc/FLBEIA_manual.pdf}{FLBEIA manual} 
to see the derivation of the formula.

The equation above is nonlinear and  therefore we cannot find an analytical expression
for the selectivity. 
Rewriting the equation above for each 'a' we have de following equation:

\deqn{ sum_{i=a_0,...a+} S_{i,f,m} \cdot B_i - \frac{C_{f,m}}{C_{a,f,m}} \cdot B_a \cdot S_{a,f,m}}

Thus we have a system of linear equations being {Sa0fm,...,Sa+fm} the unknown variables.
The problem is that the equations in the system are not independent.
Therefore, we have to remove one equation to get a system of independent equations.
Furthermore, we have to add a constraint (an equation) to be able to solve the system. 

To make sure that output is correct, we solve the sistem for each year and season several times 
(the number is set in \code{ntrials}), removing a different equation each time.
Alway using the same constraint (\code{restriction=1}):
\eqn{ sum_{i=a_0,...a+} S_{i,f,m} = 1} 
Finally, we compare the values of \eqn{ S_{i,f,m} } and we check if they are the same.
